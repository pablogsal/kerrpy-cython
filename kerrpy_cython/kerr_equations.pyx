    This function computes the right hand side of the Kerr geodesic equations described
    in http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03808.

    All the computations are highly optimized to avoid calculating the same term twice.

    :param y: pointer to double
        The current coordinate values to compute the equations. ( Will not be modified)
        The array must follow the following convention for the variables:
            0 -> r
            1 -> theta
            2 -> phi
            3 -> p_r
            4 -> p_theta

    :param f: pointer to double
        The place where the values of the equations will be stored.
        The array will follow this convention:
            0 -> d(r)/dt
            1 -> d(theta)/dt
            2 -> d(phi)/dt
            3 -> d(p_r)/dt
            4 -> d(p_theta)/dt

            Where t is the independent variable (propper time).

    :param data: pointer to double
        Aditional data needed for the computation. Explicitly:

            0 -> b ( Angular momentum)
            1 -> q ( Carter's constant)
            2 -> a ( Black Hole spin)
            3 -> e ( Energy )
